## 🎯 Intent Classification

The chatbot intelligently classifies queries into 7 categories:

| Intent | Description | Weight | Keywords |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Admissions** | Application process, eligibility | 1.2 | admission, apply, register, eligibility |
| **Exams** | Entrance exams, cutoffs, results | 1.0 | exam, jee, gate, cutoff, marks |
| **Fees** | Tuition, costs, scholarships | 1.3 | fee, tuition, cost, scholarship |
| **Placements** | Jobs, careers, salary | 1.1 | placement, job, salary, package |
| **Facilities** | Hostel, transport, infrastructure | 0.9 | hostel, transport, library, sports |
| **Academics** | Courses, curriculum, faculty | 1.0 | course, program, faculty, branch |
| **General** | Timings, contact, location | 0.8 | time, contact, address, location |

  "method": "tfidf",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "tag": "fees",
  "intent": "fees",
  "intent_confidence": 1.3
}
```

```http
POST /classify_intent
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "How do I apply for admission?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "query": "How do I apply for admission?",
  "detected_intent": "admissions",
  "confidence": 1.2,
  "all_intent_scores": {
    "admissions": 1.2,
    "fees": 0.0,
    ...
  }
}
```

### 3. View TF-IDF Debug
```http
POST /debug
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "fees and placements"
}
```

### 4. View Conversation Context
```http
GET /context
```

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Example 1: Basic Query
```
User: "What are the fees?"
Bot: 💰 [FEES STRUCTURE] B.Tech: ₹1.5 Lakhs/year, M.Tech: ₹90,000/year
Intent: fees (confidence: 1.3)
```

### Example 2: Spelling Correction
```
User: "What are the feees?"  # Misspelled
Bot: (Auto-corrects to "fees")
     💰 [FEES STRUCTURE] ...
Intent: fees
```

### Example 3: Synonym Matching
```
User: "What's the tuition cost?"  # Synonyms
Bot: (Maps: tuition→fee, cost→fee)
     💰 [FEES STRUCTURE] ...
Intent: fees
```

### Example 4: Context Awareness
```
User: "What are the fees?"
Bot: 💰 [FEES STRUCTURE] ...

User: "Tell me more"  # Follow-up
Bot: "For more details about fees, contact +91 98765 43210"
Intent: context
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Preprocessing Pipeline
```
Input Query
    ↓
Lowercase → Remove Punctuation → Tokenize
    ↓
Spelling Correction → Stopword Removal → Synonym Normalization
    ↓
Processed Tokens
```

### Response Generation Flow
```
1. Greetings/Farewells (exact match)
2. Conversation Context (follow-ups)
3. Rule-Based Patterns (edge cases)
4. Intent Classification (7 categories)
5. TF-IDF Retrieval (FAQ matching)
6. Intelligent Fallback (with suggestions)
```

## 📊 Implementation Details

### TF-IDF Algorithm
- **Term Frequency (TF)**: `count(term) / total_words`
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: `log(total_docs / docs_with_term)`
- **Cosine Similarity**: `dot(vec1, vec2) / (||vec1|| × ||vec2||)`

### Intent Classification
- **Hybrid Approach**: Keyword matching + TF-IDF-like vectors
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different priorities for different intents
- **Training Data**: Keywords + example phrases per intent

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New FAQs
Edit `FAQ_DATA` in `app.py`:
```python
FAQ_DATA.append({
    "question": "keywords for matching",
    "answer": "HTML formatted answer",
    "tag": "category"
})
```

### Adding New Intents
Update `INTENT_DEFINITIONS` in `app.py`:
```python
INTENT_DEFINITIONS["new_intent"] = {
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "examples": ["example question 1"],
    "weight": 1.0
}
```

### Adding Synonyms
Update `NORMALIZATION_MAP` in `app.py`:
```python
NORMALIZATION_MAP["synonym"] = "canonical_form"
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **FAQs**: 13 topics
- **Synonyms**: 77+ mappings
- **Spelling Corrections**: 30+ common errors
- **Intents**: 7 categories
- **Response Time**: < 100ms average
